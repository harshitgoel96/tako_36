### EC Parts

| Part            | Amount |
| --------------- | ------ |
| Housings        | 34     |
| Domes           | 34     |
| Conical springs | 34     |
| Sliders         | 34     |
| Silencing rings | 34     |

> **Note**
> If you going to use DES V3/Carrot domes then it's recommended to get DES Volcano springs to avoid sping crunch.

> **Note**
> Silencing rings are recommended. If you want the same key travel as HHKB Type-S with DES housings and DES sliders then you should get #7 rings.

> **Warning**
> I tested only with DES housings and used 14.7x14.1mm cutouts recommended by DES while original Topre often use 14.6x14mm. Original Topre housings should work just fine as well but not tested.

Some EC vendors:

- [deskeys](https://deskeys.io/)
- [Unreal Keyboard](https://unrealkeyboards.com/)

**You can only use MX-compatible sliders due to the housing orientation.** [See details](./docs/housing_orientation.md).

The top plate was tested by me using Deskeys parts only. The build on the picture using:

1. DES Carrot 35g domes
2. DES Volcano springs
3. DES Housings (Clear)
4. DES Sliders
5. DES Silencing rings #7
